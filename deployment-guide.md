## Production Deployment Requirements

### Real-Time Data Integration

#### 1. Weather Data APIs
```javascript
// Integrate with official sources:
- National Hurricane Center (NHC) API
- Jamaica Meteorological Service
- NOAA Hurricane Hunters data
- Satellite imagery feeds

// Example integration:
const weatherAPI = {
  nhcFeed: 'https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/api/...',
  metServiceJA: 'https://metservice.gov.jm/api/...',
  updateInterval: 300000 // 5 minutes
};
```

#### 2. Shelter Management System
```javascript
// Connect to ODPEM shelter database:
- Real-time capacity updates from shelter managers
- Check-in/check-out tracking
- Supply level monitoring
- Staff availability
- Medical resources on-site

const shelterAPI = {
  endpoint: 'https://odpem.gov.jm/api/shelters',
  updateFrequency: 'real-time via WebSocket'
};
```

#### 3. Emergency Dispatch Integration
```javascript
// Connect to 119 emergency services:
- Direct integration with dispatch centers
- Automatic prioritization algorithm
- GPS verification
- Duplicate report detection
- Status updates to reporters

const emergencyDispatch = {
  endpoint: 'wss://119.emergency.gov.jm',
  authentication: 'OAuth2 + API keys',
  encryption: 'TLS 1.3'
};
```

### Mobile App Deployment

#### Progressive Web App (PWA)
```json
{
  "name": "Jamaica Emergency Response",
  "short_name": "JM Emergency",
  "start_url": "/",
  "display": "standalone",
  "background_color": "#dc2626",
  "theme_color": "#dc2626",
  "icons": [
    {
      "src": "/icon-192.png",
      "sizes": "192x192",
      "type": "image/png"
    },
    {
      "src": "/icon-512.png",
      "sizes": "512x512",
      "type": "image/png"
    }
  ],
  "offline_enabled": true
}
```

#### Offline Functionality
- Cache critical data locally
- Queue emergency reports for submission when connection restored
- Stored shelter information
- Safety guidelines available offline
- Progressive enhancement

### Backend Architecture

#### Recommended Stack
```
Frontend: React/React Native
Backend: Node.js with Express
Database: PostgreSQL (main) + Redis (caching)
Real-time: Socket.io or WebSocket
Hosting: AWS/Google Cloud with multi-region redundancy
CDN: CloudFlare for DDoS protection
```

#### Database Schema
```sql

  location_lat DECIMAL(10, 8),
  location_lng DECIMAL(11, 8),
  description TEXT NOT NULL,
  contact_phone VARCHAR(20),
  status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'pending',
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  assigned_to INTEGER REFERENCES responders(id),
  resolved_at TIMESTAMP
);

-- Shelters
CREATE TABLE shelters (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  parish VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  address TEXT,
  capacity INTEGER,
  current_occupancy INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'available',
  contact_phone VARCHAR(20),
  latitude DECIMAL(10, 8),
  longitude DECIMAL(11, 8),
  facilities JSONB,
  last_updated TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Weather Updates
CREATE TABLE weather_updates (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,

```

### Security Considerations

1. **Authentication**
   - OAuth2 for government officials
   - SMS verification for emergency reports
   - API key rotation
   - Rate limiting to prevent abuse

2. **Data Protection**
   - End-to-end encryption for sensitive data
   - HIPAA compliance for medical information
   - GDPR/data privacy compliance
   - Secure storage of personal information

3. **Infrastructure**
